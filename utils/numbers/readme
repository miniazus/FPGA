Signed Unbiased Rounding: SignedUnbiasedRounding.sv
  This module performs unbiased rounding (round-half-to-even) for signed fixed-point inputs. 
  It truncates the fractional bits of the input, performs rounding based on the fractional part, 
  and saturates the output if rounding causes overflow.

Unsigned Unbiased Rounding: UnsignedUnbiasedRounding.sv
  This module performs unbiased rounding (round-half-to-even) for unsigned fixed-point inputs. 
  It truncates the fractional bits of the input, performs rounding based on the fractional part, 
  and saturates the output if rounding causes overflow.

Multi Input Adder: MultiInputAdder.sv
  This module performs signed addition of multiple input values. The number of inputs is parameterizable. 
  The output width is automatically extended by $clog2(NUM_INPUT) bits to prevent  overflow. 
  Designed for use in arithmetic datapaths or DSP pipelines where accumulation of several fixed-point signals is required.
